NOTE:
 You can experiment with any images with its type(like jpeg,jpg)(your own choice).
   Make sure there will be some overlapping parts.
between two consecutive created images in a sequence. then only algorithm will find and match features and create panorama 
image of all images which you have provided. 
- 

OR you can directly feed multiple images from camera in a sequence with some 
overlapping parts between two consecutive images. 




Please install Libraries:


1. Numpy

2. OpenCV (version 3.3.0)

3. imutils



TO RUN CODE:
  

1. Put images in your current folder where your code is present.


2. Run main.py code.

3. Provide the number of images you want to concantenate as input. Like: 2,5,6,10 etc.


4. Enter the image name in order of left to right in way of concantenation. 
        Like:
    Enter the 1 image: first.jpeg

                 Enter the 2 image: second.jpeg

                 Enter the 3 image: third.jpeg
 
                 .............................
                 .............................


5. Then, you will get your panorama image as output_image.jpg in your current folder.
 

- Used SIFT to detect feature and then RANSAC, compute Homography and matched points and warp prespective to get final panoramic image.



Result of first.jpeg and second.jpeg
 
 is output_image.jpeg.
